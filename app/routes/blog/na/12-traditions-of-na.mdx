The 12 Traditions of NA are the **group guidelines** for Narcotics Anonymous. 

These principles ensure that groups operate in a way that promotes unity and freedom. Without these traditions, NA might not even exist.

Let's take a look at the **12 Traditions of NA**.

## The 12 Traditions of NA

### Tradition 1
> Our common welfare should come first; personal recovery
depends on NA unity.

### Tradition 2
> For our group purpose there is but one ultimate authority—
a loving God as He may express Himself in our group
conscience. Our leaders are but trusted servants; they do
not govern.

### Tradition 3
> The only requirement for membership is a desire to stop using.

### Tradition 4
> Each group should be autonomous except in matters
affecting other groups or NA as a whole.

### Tradition 5
> Each group has but one primary purpose—to carry the
message to the addict who still suffers.

### Tradition 6
> An NA group ought never endorse, finance, or lend the NA
name to any related facility or outside enterprise, lest
problems of money, property, or prestige divert us from our
primary purpose.

### Tradition 7
> Every NA group ought to be fully self-supporting, declining
outside contributions.

### Tradition 8
>  Narcotics Anonymous should remain forever nonprofessional,
but our service centers may employ special workers

### Tradition 9
>  NA, as such, ought never be organized, but we may create
service boards or committees directly responsible to those
they serve.

### Tradition 10
> Narcotics Anonymous has no opinion on outside issues; hence
the NA name ought never be drawn into public controversy.

### Tradition 11
> Our public relations policy is based on attraction rather than
promotion; we need always maintain personal anonymity at
the level of press, radio, and films.

### Tradition 12
> Anonymity is the spiritual foundation of all our Traditions,
ever reminding us to place principles before personalities.

## Why the 12 Traditions Are Important

If you've ever attended a meeting of Natcotics Anonymous, you are probably familiar with the 12 traditions of NA. 

These traditions were created as a set of principles and guidelines for the way in which **NA groups** should operate as a whole. 

Adherance to these principles promotes **unity** and **freedom** within a NA group. 

These traditions also protect NA groups from outside forces that could harm the fellowship of Narcotics Anonymous. 

Without the 12 traditions, the NA program wouldn't be as successful as it is today at helping addicts achieve freedom from drugs.
